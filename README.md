Code and data to accompany paper "The Pattern Method for Incorporating Tidal
Uncertainty Into Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (PTHA)" by L.M.
Adams, R.J. LeVeque, and F.I. Gonzalez, to appear in 
[Natural Hazards](http://link.springer.com/journal/11069).
A preprint is posted at
[http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7216](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7216).

The code provided here illustrates the basic methodology in ways that might
be adapted to other work.  Some of the illustrative figures in the paper can be
reproduced, but we have not included all of the Crescent City modeling codes
that were used to produce the figures specific to that application.  That
work was performed as part of the project report posted at
http://hdl.handle.net/1773/25916.

See `programs/README` for more information and instructions.
