On March 3,2014, we sent the adamstide.pdf to the Natural Hazards journal.

On October 14,2014, a modified paper was accepted to the Natural Hazards journal.

In the programs directory you will find python programs related to the paper 
with typical input and output as described below.


   THE (2) PATTERN-METHOD PROGRAMS: (Illustrated for a typical Cascadia
                                     Bandon source called CSZBe01r07)

   1. pattern_fromgauge.py: Driver and program to create the pattern

      run:    python pattern_fromgauge.py CSZBe01r07

      input:  User edits the top of this code as indicated to select parameters
              gauge101_t_eta.txt (tsunami CSZBe01r07 Geoclaw gauge time series) 
    
      output: pattern.txt  job run history, last two lines give the pattern
                           (waves_indices and waves_adjust) to be input to 
                           pattern_yearly_run.py and the amplitude
                           A will be output as the 4th line from the bottom
                           of this file.

   2. pattern_yearly_run.py: Driver to make cumulative distribution from pattern

              run:    python pattern_yearly_run.py CSZBe01r07

              calls:  pattern_yearly.py

              input:  predicted.npy (yearly tidal data file for Crescent City)

                      User specifies which tsunami, and other data including
                      the pattern in waves_indices and waves_adjust

                      Optionally, one can specify the amplitude and whether 
                      the G-Method plots should be included on the plots for
                      comparison. See the present setup under the CSZBe01r07
                      tsunami in the code pattern_yearly_run.py. The amplitude
                      A is not needed to make the pattern, but it is required
                      to find the pdf and cumulative distributions for the
                      G-Method. These optional parameters are called A and
                      Gplot in the code.  If used, A should be in meters and
                      Gplot=True. This amplitude A is written out in the 4th
                      the 4th line from the bottom of file pattern.txt and
                      Gplot=True is on the 3rd line from the bottom, in case
                      these choices are desired.

                      pdf_pattern.txt           (pdf)
                      cumulative_pattern.txt    (cumulative distribution)
